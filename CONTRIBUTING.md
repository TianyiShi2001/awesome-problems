At present, most other awesome lists are just plain lists. As they grow, it becomes more difficult for readers to filter out the links that best suit their needs. Therefore, in this repo, all list items, each with rich metadata, are stored in `awesome.json`, which will make future re-organisation and upgrade of views *much* easier.
